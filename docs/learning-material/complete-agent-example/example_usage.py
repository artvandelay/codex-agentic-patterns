Complete Agent Example Usage Demo

This file demonstrates how to use the Codex-inspired agent implementation
combining multiple agentic design patterns.

Prerequisites:
    pip install openai aiohttp

Usage:
    python example_usage.py

This example shows:
- Pattern 1: Prompt Chaining (multi-turn conversations)
- Pattern 2: Routing (tool dispatch)
- Pattern 5: Tool Use (external integration)
- Pattern 8: Memory Management (conversation persistence)
- Pattern 12: Exception Handling (retry logic)
- Pattern 13: Human-in-the-Loop (approval workflows)
